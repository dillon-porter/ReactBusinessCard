Created a react app from module 1 from Bob Ziroll's - Learn React for Free on Scrimba (Updated 2021).
This was a solo project assignment, there was no coded solution for this project. 
We took a figma design and coded everything from scratch!

The Figma file can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/4ctPLUvIn5b5Ep6YPOZWWd/Digital-Business-Card?node-id=0%3A1

The coded solution: https://dillon-porter.github.io/reactbusinesscard/
